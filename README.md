# Project Title
Webserver Hosting Solution

This project is the design, proposal, and implementation of a webserver solution for the Charleston Southern University Computer Science department. The goal for this project is to design a solution for students and faculty to host the websites that they design that are needed to complete various coursework, without independently researching and purchasing hosting services on various sites. This will be accomplished through an IT decision process that considers cost, functionality, longevity, and support and maintainability. This solution will provide for up to one hundred fifty websites to give students and faculty the ability to easily manage the hosting of their various coursework. Furthermore, it will give cohesiveness to the department to have websites all hosted the same way and serve as an opportunity for students to develop professional skills by deploying websites.
